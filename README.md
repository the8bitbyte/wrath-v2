## wrath-v2.42.4

wrath is a computer virus made by me with the help of chat gpt.
this was made for fun, without malicious intent

wrath used a powershell script to bypass some restrictions implented by windows to stop viruses. wrath is a very simple virus and does not inject its code into executables but rather replaces them with itself. wrath also has a discord webhook built into it so it notifys me when it infects a new machine. wrath currently has no payload, all it does is infect files, i plan to release a new version in the future with a payload.
